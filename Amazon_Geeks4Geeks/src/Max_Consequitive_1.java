//Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

//Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

//Example 1:

//Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
//Output: 6
//Explanation: 
//[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
//Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
//Example 2:

//Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
//Output: 10
//Explanation: 
//[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
//Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
